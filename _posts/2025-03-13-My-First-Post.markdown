It's a chilly Thursday evening, and I have the windows of my dorm open to the purple horizon beyond my academy's lifeless courtyard. All are gone on break, and I have recently returned to enjoy my peace before the Spring trimester's beginning. I had been on a ship for all of four months, and briefly tasted the future that I have been working for until two year's time. Now that things have settled down, I need to get back to writing my book.

Upon my windowsill is an electric kettle, pouring faint steam into the sky; my coffee from sea; sencha, peach, vanilla, and tangerine tea, which stand before two glass bottles: rose and orange blossom water; a couple tea diffusers, a french press, and an empty flower glass (which had just survived valentines with a girl whose name was Madison). The tea and related objects were retrieved this morning of, from the post office in the school's basement. My mother sent them on a pinhead the moment I asked how she made that tea when I visited her this New Years. It was my expressed intention to retrieve my car, you see, where I had left it at her place for sea. It had barely made the drive, and my mother sent me a picture of the roadside assistance policy I already knew I had. She would come save me if my car broke down. Did I have enough money? These were her concerns.

There was music playing which I put on. Lovely wordless piano, which I selected from my other ambient playlists for being particularly suited to sip tea to. 'Tea Shi', I titled it, as in 'Tea Shit' but significantly less repulsive. (If I may make a reccomendation, listen to Ulpiano II while you read this!)

That's why my kettle was steaming. I just made tea. It is the recipe I had asked her for. "The sweet tangerine positive energy blend is what I used. half to one capful of each rose and orange blossom. Agave is on its way, as well". I used honey in lieu of the agave, which had such a characteristic taste because she poured it into everything until I begged her to 'Stop!'. I can't describe it, the taste. It's hot tangerine and rose, and fullbodied like no other tea. I really did want it for my evenings, that's the only reason I asked.

But now I wanted her to see that I was enjoying it. This was our conversation:

&ensp;&ensp;Me: Absolutely delectable

&ensp;&ensp;Her: Lunar :crescent_moon: Eclipse\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Tomorrow!\
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;...you can combine the sweet tangerine positive energy with the sencha.

&ensp;&ensp;Me: Will enjoy them together with tomorrow's eclipse, then!

She always had something astrological to say, for she believed in the influences of astrological bodies. I did not, and this was unshakeable, even though I would not disbelieve in anything (as is my pursuit). In a similar way to how she believed in the pseudological claims of the tea, 'positive energy: supports focus and energy levels\*'. Of course her perception would not include an asterisk. This spawned a google search, for I had to check. There would be an eclipse tomorrow night. She was right. A total lunar eclipse, the first in three years. This latter notion bugged me, for I am skeptical of claims that things are rare or special. But this was true, as well. I recalled my mother, a few years before, always talking about lunar eclipses, "Wierd things keep happening, Monty, what's gonna happen?". I couldn't keep my face straight. "It's not funny! This is real!". Ah, of course there was one night in particular. The first time I had asked a girl out. I was rejected. My world fell apart, and I passed out in my truck by a firepit on the beach. I woke up with a face streaked in salt, and the firepit was alive. I had it to myself, and that night it staved off the chilliest of winds. My mother had told me there would be a 97% lunar eclipse that night. I thought I might ask this girl to see it with me. Well I was alone with this fire, and thereabove was an orange moon, with a pinch of solar white upon the edge. Three percent, I supposed, to be exact. It occured to me that I should invite my mother to the fire. Not because I wanted to divulge in her the whirlwind emotions that I felt. Not to hear her advice, as my mother. Actually, I didn't want to invite her (this, I am sorry to say). But I knew I should, as a decent thing. So I did. And she drove up in a heartbeat. And I told her nothing. In fact, I do recall many orange moons that year. Enough that I assumed they were common, and I had been too imperceptive until then to notice. It is only at this sip of tea that I realized weird things *had* been happening, then.

&ensp;&ensp;Me: First total eclipse since 2022! As I recall, there were many eclspses and astronomical anomalies that year...

She hearted my message.

I feel buzzed. Maybe it's the caffeine, or maybe the 'positive energy*'. Who am I to say? I feel a fondness for that night, that I decided to invite her. It was the right thing to do. Where might her advice have led me? She is with an older man. He is good for her, although I lament his nature in numerous ways. As of recent, I have developed a new sorrowful fondness for my mother. My book largely consists of all the ways I hated her. Or still do. But the book is about my love for her, and others. I haven't finished this yet, of course. I still can't quite tell you why I love her. But I know that I do. Ah, and didn't she love me too! How much she cared. I am her child, after all. During my drive back up to school, it occured to me how gaping my absence must be for her. A child! Her constant work of labor and love. She RAISED me, I was her purpose for so many years. And now, how she must hear the silence of me, louder than any baby's cry, louder than I called my friends through the night, louder than any shout in an argument of ours. I should talk to her, sometimes. That's what occured to me.

I wanted to see her in front of me, dear reader. I couldn't tell you why. But upon pulling up her Facebook profile, and swiping past the odious quotes she posted, I saw her. It was on our boat, in Panama, with my sister, and our dog. And the way she smiled-- there was an otherwordly innocence to that smile. Such a childish innocence that I burst into tears. Gasping, desperate tears! What would she say? "This world isn't meant for me." Reader, no truer of a statement had ever she said. She was so pure for this hateful world! There was a boundary in her mind, through which no fact, reason, or argument I ever made could bridge. She would not accept the scientific way that I believed, because there is a child in her that needs the world to be whimsical. She could not survive otherwise. And this boundary was one that I so ardently wanted, a sense of wonder in this world. She had it, encapsulated in that sorrowful smile! Reader, all my teenage life I knew she had problems. My father said it, "She's Bipolar!" he believed, "If she'd just admit it, my god!" Others said it too. And it's true. She's struggled with depression for as long as I've known the word's meaning. It runs in her family. But oh dear reader, I am the luckiest child alive that at no point would she ever consider the fact! "I'M NOT BIPOLAR!" she would rage. "DON'T CALL ME THAT!". I could never understand it. But now I could. If she were bipolar, than there would be a medication for her. And I know, now, the truth of those medications. My mother would be gone if she were medicated. I would not have a mother, but a person who I called mom. Just as there is a guy named Sy who I call a friend. Just as there was a girl named Leslie who she called her sister. Her aunt, her mother. Just as I have a friend whose name is Kearns, who I am so grateful for having never touched an antidepressant. How strong must she have been! So many years she fought against this idea that everyone around implied was her solution! Her OWN CHILDREN! And wistfully she stuck to her psuedosciences, astrology, asterisked claims, because she KNEW, better than anybody, that there was no solution for her. Oh reader, it's so unfair! I am endlessly lucky that she was so strong. Because if she hadn't have been, I would have lost my mother in the despressive throes of Nashville, seventh grade. I would have gone all through highschool without a mother. I would be sitting here, right now, drinking the blandest of teas, because she had not the passion to send me hers, nor the wistfullness to concoct such a curious blend. Today I have a mother, and I will never forget that.
